/**
 * Finish setup — the App wires what the guided setup session is not allowed to.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The setup session runs in `auto` permission mode (renderer: spawnSetupSession),
 * and SETUP.md asks it to register the skills, install the AIOS plugin, install the `spawn`
 * wrapper (it writes the operator's PowerShell `$PROFILE` / `~/.zshrc`) and wire the hooks into
 * `~/.claude/settings.json`. Auto mode's classifier blocks exactly that class of change by default
 * — shell-profile persistence, edits to the agent's own settings and skills, `-ExecutionPolicy
 * Bypass` — and in auto mode a block raises no permission dialog. So the session does what it is
 * told to on a denial: it hands the operator `!` lines to paste. On Windows that is where first
 * installs stalled — Claude Code hard-wraps long lines, a copied command arrives split in two, and
 * the `!` lines were pasted into a separate PowerShell window where `!` means nothing.
 *
 * The App can run these installers itself, in its own lane (the doctor already did for two of
 * them). The consent is a click on a button that names each change; nothing here works around the
 * classifier, because the AI is not the one executing.
 *
 * Pure by design (no fs, no exec, no electron), like core/onboarding.ts: aios.ts feeds it real
 * check results and a real repair function; the tests feed it fabricated ones.
