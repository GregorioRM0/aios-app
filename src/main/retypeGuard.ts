 * Re-type, or has the earlier type already landed? Asked right before EVERY re-type.

 * 26 Oct 2026, measured: a send went to a session that turned busy during verification. The
 * verdict was 'wait', the loop held until the target was idle again, and then typed the message a
 * second time, because the late-arrival check ran only once the attempts were spent. By then the
 * first copy was in the transcript: the operator got the same message twice, 33 s apart, and the
 * App's own counter logged DUPLICATE DELIVERY. A busy target finishes its turn and writes the text
 * it was given; the only safe moment to decide on a re-type is after re-reading.
 *
 * App-only on purpose: core/sendQueue.ts is pinned byte-for-byte to the Glass fulfiller
 * (protocolContract SENDQUEUE_SHA). This changes no decision table, only when the App re-reads.
